# Exchange Architecture (Minimal)

## Components
- Matching Engine (services/exchange-engine): limit order book with REST API.
- Market Data: publish top-of-book/trades (websockets later).
- Settlement: integrate fills with Ledger; batch to custodians/banks.
- Risk: per-account limits, pre-trade checks, reconciliation.

## Roadmap
- Persist engine with per-order queues and FIFO.
- Add websockets and FIX gateway (optional).
- Add funding/withdrawal with KYC + sanctions checks.
- Fees: maker/taker schedules, referrals.
