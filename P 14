# Licensing & Partnerships

To connect to SWIFT in production, either:
- Become a direct SWIFT participant (BIC, rigorous audits), or
- Integrate via a sponsor bank and/or SWIFT service bureau.

## Typical Paths
- US: Money transmitter licenses per-state or partner with a licensed MSB, plus sponsor bank/BaaS (e.g., Evolve, Cross River, Stripe Treasury, Unit).
- EU/UK: EMI or PI via local regulator (e.g., FCA), or operate under an EMIâ€™s agency model.

## Must-Haves
- AML program, MLRO, transaction monitoring, sanctions screening.
- KYC/KYB, data retention, auditability.
- InfoSec controls (SOC2/ISO27001), incident response.
- Transparent ToS/Privacy policies and customer support processes.
